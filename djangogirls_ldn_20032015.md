slide2:
Yes, everyone can learn to code
----
-> hobby or (part of) your job

I learned > 2 years ago at @Hackbright Academy
I'm currently a *junior* Data Scientist @MastodonC

slide3:
People working with computers:
---
-> Web devs, web designers, software eng (desktop, mobile, ganes...),
QA, DevOps, Sys Admin, Data engineers, Hardware eng, Data Analysts/Scientists...

slide4:
Data is in the air!
----
-> Data Scientist has become the "sexiest" job title
-> ... but what is it really?

"It's a high-ranking professional with the training and curiosity to make 
discoveries in the world of big data." - HBR, 2012

slide5:
So basically a DS:
---
-> makes sense of data to get insights / trends.
-> makes predictions based on data anlysis.

slide6:
What I like
-----
Data is everywhere. It's generated continuously.
You can use it to have fun, solve problems, improve businesses, generate art...

Data is more and more open.
Internet of Things means more sensors and therefore more data!
